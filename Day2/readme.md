As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named rose requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:



Create a user named rose on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-04-15, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.
